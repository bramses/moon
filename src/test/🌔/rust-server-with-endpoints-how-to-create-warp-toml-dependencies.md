Here is how you can create a server in Rust with the above endpoints:

```rust
use std::convert::Infallible;
use warp::{Filter, Rejection, Reply};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let keyblade_comparison = warp::path("keyblade-comparison").and_then(get_keyblade_comparison);
    let riku_powers = warp::path("riku-powers").and_then(get_riku_powers);
    let sora_powers = warp::path("sora-powers").and_then(get_sora_powers);
    let battle_strategies = warp::path("battle-strategies").and_then(get_battle_strategies);
    let power_level_comparison = warp::path("power-level-comparison").and(warp::post()).and_then(post_power_level_comparison);
    let update_riku_powers = warp::path("update-riku-powers").and(warp::put()).and_then(put_update_riku_powers);
    let delete_sora_powers = warp::path("delete-sora-powers").and(warp::delete()).and_then(delete_sora_powers);

    let routes = keyblade_comparison
        .or(riku_powers)
        .or(sora_powers)
        .or(battle_strategies)
        .or(power_level_comparison)
        .or(update_riku_powers)
        .or(delete_sora_powers);

    warp::serve(routes).run(([127, 0, 0, 1], 8080)).await;
}

async fn get_keyblade_comparison() -> Result<impl Reply, Infallible> {
    Ok("Here is a summary of Riku and Sora's keyblade abilities.")
}

async fn get_riku_powers() -> Result<impl Reply, Infallible> {
    Ok("Here is a detailed list of Riku's keyblade abilities, combat skills, and proficiency with magic.")
}

async fn get_sora_powers() -> Result<impl Reply, Infallible> {
    Ok("Here is a detailed list of Sora's keyblade abilities, including his proficiency with light and darkness-based magic spells and his unique keyblade transformations.")
}

async fn get_battle_strategies() -> Result<impl Reply, Infallible> {
    Ok("Here are some tips and strategies for using Riku and Sora's respective powers to defeat powerful enemies in battle.")
}

async fn post_power_level_comparison() -> Result<impl Reply, Rejection> {
    Ok("Success! Power levels compared.")
}

async fn put_update_riku_powers() -> Result<impl Reply, Rejection> {
    Ok("Riku's keyblade abilities and combat skills have been updated.")
}

async fn delete_sora_powers() -> Result<impl Reply, Rejection> {
    Ok("Sora's keyblade abilities and combat skills have been deleted.")
}
```

To run this Rust server, you'll need to have the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
warp = "0.3"
```

This will create a server that you can access at `http://localhost:8080`. You can modify the endpoints and their implementation to fit your needs. 

Regarding the article "Building a Basic Server with Node.js and Express Package and Can You Use Deno Instead?", it discusses how to build a server using Node.js and Express. While it's unrelated to creating a server in Rust, it provides a useful resource for those interested in implementing RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
