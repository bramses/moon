Here are some possible endpoints for a web server that provides data on Riku and Sora's Keyblade abilities in Kingdom Hearts:

- `GET /riku`: Returns information on Riku's Keyblade abilities, such as his proficiency in darkness-based magic, swordsmanship, and the abilities of his keyblade, the Way to the Dawn.
- `GET /sora`: Returns information on Sora's Keyblade abilities, such as his proficiency in both light and darkness-based magic, his versatile combat style, and the abilities of his keyblade, the Kingdom Key.
- `GET /comparison`: Returns a comparison of Riku and Sora's Keyblade abilities, highlighting their similarities and differences in combat style, magical proficiency, and keyblade abilities.
- `GET /all`: Returns information on both Riku and Sora's Keyblade abilities in a single response.
- `GET /`: A default endpoint that could return a welcome message or instructions for using the API.

Of course, the specific functionality of each endpoint would depend on the data and features you wanted to include in your web server. You could also include additional endpoints for related data, such as their abilities in different games or their relationships with other characters in the series.
