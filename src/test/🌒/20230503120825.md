command: why is this code causing multipe user inputs to show up sometimes func promptUserInput() string {
	prompt := promptui.Prompt{
		Label: "Enter input",
	}

	result, err := prompt.Run()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Prompt failed %v\n", err)
		return ""
	}

	return result
}

The code is causing multiple user inputs to show up because the function `promptUserInput()` is being called multiple times. Each time the function is called, it creates a new prompt for the user to enter their input. 

To avoid this issue, you can try to store the user input once it is prompted and use it for subsequent processing. Another solution would be to ensure that the function is only called when necessary or limit the number of times it can be called.
