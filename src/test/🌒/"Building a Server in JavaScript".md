To build a server in JavaScript, you have a few options. One popular option is to use Node.js, a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Here are the basic steps to build a server in Node.js:

1. Install Node.js on your computer
2. Create a new folder for your server project
3. Open a command prompt or terminal in the new folder
4. Initialize a new Node.js project using the `npm init` command
5. Install any necessary Node.js packages, such as the `express` package for creating a web server
6. Write your server code using JavaScript and save it in a file with a `.js` extension
7. Run the server using the `node` command followed by the name of your server file
